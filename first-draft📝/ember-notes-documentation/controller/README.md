# Controller

the controller is kinda of a add-on to the route, controller have access to the model, the route can setup things into the controller through `setupController`

but controller can specified many property to the component/template and actions

## Where and When to use Controllers?[-](https://guides.emberjs.com/v3.12.0/controllers/#toc_where-and-when-to-use-controllers)

Controllers are used as an extension of the model loaded from the Route. Any attributes or actions that we want to share with components used on that Route could be defined on the Controller and passed down through the Route’s template.

**Controllers are singletons so we should avoid keeping state that does not derive from either the Model or Query Parameters since these would persist in between activations such as when a user leaves the Route and then re-enters it.**

Controllers can also contain actions that enable the Route's components to update the Model or Query Parameters through it using Computed Properties

## Common questions

>Should we use controllers in my application?

I've heard they're going away!
Yes! Controllers are still an integral part of an Ember application architecture, and generated by the framework even if you don't declare a Controller module explicitly.

>When should we create a Controller?

- We want to pass down actions or variables to share with a Route’s child components
- We have a computed property that depends on the results of the model hook
- We need to support query parameters

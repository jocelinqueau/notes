## normalization

applies to RDBMS, 1970 Edgar Codd

he defined 1st, 2nd and 3rd normal form

> the key, the whole key & nothing but the key

## 1 nromal form

Every row must be unique, no repeating groups, ie MVA no

## 2 nromal form

no partial key dependencies

![second](./second.png)

## 3 normal form

no non key dependencies

![third](./third.png)

## conceptual to logical

- Transform M:M relationship

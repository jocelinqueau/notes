# Branching and Merging

The Git feature that really makes it stand apart from nearly every other SCM out there is its branching model.

- **Frictionless Context Switching**, ie doing work in multiple branch, merging etc
- **Role-Based Codelines(or branch)**. Have a branch that always contains only what goes to production, another that you merge work into for testing, and several smaller ones for day to day work.
- Feature Based Workflow
- Disposable Experimentation

Notably, when you push to a remote repository, you do not have to push all of your branches. You can choose to share just one of your branches, a few of them, or all of them. This tends to free people to try new ideas without worrying about having to plan how and when they are going to merge it in or share it with others.

There are ways to accomplish some of this with other systems, but the work involved is much more difficult and error-prone. Git makes this process incredibly easy and it changes the way most developers work when they learn it.
